Place the bot files in bot folder (with node_modules).
the bot's main file should be bot.js.

You can build this application and place the bot folder in a manually created "bot" folder too!
ex. build app with electron-packager/electron-builder and in the place of the executable make a folder called bot and place the files inside.
